# Weather App

The Weather App allows users to check the current weather of any city. The app fetches weather data from the WeatherAPI and displays real-time information like temperature, weather condition, and humidity. It also displays a beautiful background image related to the city, fetched from Unsplash.

## Features

- **Weather Information**: Displays the current temperature, weather condition, and humidity for the input city.
- **Background Image**: Fetches a beautiful background image related to the city from Unsplash to make the app visually appealing.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive interface with input fields and a button to get weather information.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML**: Used for structuring the content.
- **CSS**: Used for styling and making the app look modern with smooth animations.
- **JavaScript**: Handles the fetching of weather data from WeatherAPI and images from Unsplash, and updates the UI dynamically.

## APIs

This project uses two public APIs to get weather data and images:

1. **WeatherAPI**: Provides real-time weather information based on the city name.
   - Get your API key from [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/).

2. **Unsplash API**: Provides beautiful, high-quality images to be used as the background for the app.
   - Get your API key from [Unsplash Developers](https://unsplash.com/developers).

You need to replace the API keys in the `script.js` file with your own keys in order for the app to work.

## How to Use

1. Open the app in a browser.
2. Enter the name of any city in the input field.
3. Click the **Get Weather** button.
4. View the current temperature, weather condition, and humidity for the city.
5. The app will also display a background image related to the city from Unsplash.

## Styling and Animations

The app uses CSS animations to make it visually engaging:
- Smooth transitions for the weather information.
- Subtle animations for buttons and inputs to enhance the user experience.
- A responsive layout that works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
